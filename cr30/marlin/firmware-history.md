1. [NAK 3D Designs](https://github.com/NAK3DDesigns/CR-30-Firmware)
   - Walkthrough video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c2PW5GNZrE)
   - Allows a negative Y-axis offset

     - Files [added to git](https://github.com/NAK3DDesigns/CR-30-Firmware/commit/67b5507495e8654373dcab4a65e7a53a726939eb) on 8 Mar 2021
     - `STRING_DISTRIBUTION_DATE "2021-01-01"`
     - `MARLIN_HEX_VERSION 020008`
     - Seems to match upstream commit [`4402a05`](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/blob/4402a0578a9fa5c9743eb5774224ce206c618ce9/Marlin/src/inc/Version.h)

1. [CrealityOfficial](https://github.com/CrealityOfficial/cr-30)
   - One commit of Marlin with CR-30 support [on 15 Mar 2022](https://github.com/CrealityOfficial/cr-30/commit/a916aa2815684ec39e166340b85808e70dfe7fec)
   - Git history squashed
     - `inc/Version.h` has `SHORT_BUILD_VERSION "2.0.6.3"`
     - Marlin official has no release or tag for this version, the closest is `2.0.6.1`
     - When diffing this tree against Creality's fork, there are **257** changed files
     - For tag `2.0.6` on 26 Jul 2020, there are **36** changed files
     - It seems like Creality was guessing a version that would include support for the CR-30
     - Or maybe they chose a version number that wouldn't be used so that they could have a 'signature version'
   - Added repeat markers
   - Added pause print on SD timeout

## Identify changes to keep

Some changes don't compile, and some might have been for prototype models. Remove the changes that cannot be built and tested, and re-evaluate the remaining changes for safety and recency.

### Initial introduction of CR-30 firmware

- **Compare:** CR30-Users `cr-30-base`
- **Base:** Nearest-neighbor official Marlin firmware with co-temporal Offical Marlin CR-30 config files
  - Which upstream commit is the parent?
    ```
    $ git log --oneline -n3
    c93a97279e (HEAD, tag: cr-30-base) Initial CR-30 firmware
    b9d9e74f2c [cron] Bump distribution date (2021-01-02)
    4402a0578a Fix CHAMBER_FAN_MODE 0 build (#20621)
    ```
  - Parent [upstream firmware commit](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/commit/b9d9e74f2cfce8e53b315e72366dc49c5550c4c6) is `b9d9e74`
  - Corresponding [upstream config commit](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/commit/0a8dfe5594ca981428c9adf76068e3cbe425c3ba) is `0a8dfe5`
- **Diff**
  - [Available on GitHub](https://github.com/CR30-Users/Marlin-CR30/commit/c93a97279eadbb5fb3757a7c7e7696690b90b328)
    - Some of these changes were brought into upstream (pull requests linked above)
    - Some were not, like the side-band multilanguage implementation

### Subsequent community changes

More closely evaluate [the diffs between the community and upstream](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/compare/2.0.x...CR30-Users:Marlin-CR30:2.0.x_cr30). Choosing mainline seems ok if the community diffs don't add improvements.

- **Compare:** CR30-Users `2.0.x_cr30`
- **Base:** Nearest-neighbor official Marlin firmware with co-temporal Offical Marlin CR-30 config files
  - Which upstream commit is the parent?
    ```
    $ git log --oneline -n3
    4c8cd975d6 (HEAD, tag: latest, tag: 2.0.9.3_cr30, origin/HEAD, origin/2.0.x_cr30, 2.0.x_cr30) Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/2.0.x' into 2.0.x_cr30
    16f92d673a üî® Add .vscode/extensions.json
    f17f458e91 üêõ Fix RRW Keypad & Zonestar buttons (#23388)
    ```
  - Parent [upstream firmware commit](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/commits/73b8320e9caac23873169c8e10344f2f8060b389) is `73b8320` _(just after 2.0.9.3)_
  - Corresponding [upstream config commit](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/commit/820725c157fe82720ab4b1f236d885c7f2dd84ea) is `820725c`
- **Diff**
  - The branch comparison above reflects most of this
    - However that comparison also shows both _release_ and _bugfix_ branches being merged from upstream, so some history is remixed with each rebase
    - Further the comparison is against the **default** configuration files from Marlin, not against the CR-30 configuration files from Marlin
  - We can recreate a pull request diff by taking the file trees from the upstream commits linked above and diffing the unified tree against the latest tree from CR30-Users
    1. Base: [Copy the upstream CR-30 configuration](./history/0001-Marlin-apply-CR-30-configuration-to-default-files.patch.md) into the upstream firmware tree
    1. Compare: [Apply the CR30-Users changes](./history/0002-CR30-Users-Add-community-customizations.patch.md) to the unified upstream tree
  - These differences are listed below

### Questions and actions
- See the [CR-30 Users wiki](https://github.com/CR30-Users/Marlin-CR30/wiki)
- How many of these require re-working the board?
  - **No** firmware changes listed above require a rework
  - Removing `STANDALONE` from the `TMC2208` stepper driver configuration requires a rework of the main board
    - Depopulate a resistor for each stepper driver
    - Solder a wire in its place
    - Connect it to an IO header
  - Should be separated into its own patch
- How many just need a plug moved to a different socket?
  - Harmless because fans remain always-on even if their connections are never changed
  - Still should be separated into its own patch
  - Controller fan `K-FAN3`
  - Auto-on hotend fan `K-FAN2`
- Wiki has an extra mod for NeoPixels
  - Also requires a board rework
    - Splice pins on connectors between signals and sensors
  - Should be separated into its own patch
